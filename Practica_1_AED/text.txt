(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the moonlit night,
Whispers weave through shadows,
A symphony of forgotten dreams,
Echoes of love and sorrow.

(Pre-Chorus)
Stars collide, ignite the canvas,
Painting constellations in cosmic hues,
The universe hums its ancient song,
As we dance on stardust and muse.

(Chorus)
Oh, the echoes of the midnight sky,
A celestial ballad of secrets untold,
Each note a comet streaking by,
In this cosmic theater, our story unfolds.

(Verse 2)
Galaxies spin like vinyl records,
Their grooves etched with cosmic tales,
Black holes sing bass, quasars soprano,
And nebulas weep celestial veils.

(Bridge)
I strum the strings of Orion's lyre,
Compose melodies from meteor showers,
The Milky Way a grand staff of wonder,
Notes written in interstellar hours.

(Chorus)
Oh, the echoes of the midnight sky,
A celestial ballad of secrets untold,
Each note a comet streaking by,
In this cosmic theater, our story unfolds.

(Interlude)
Saturn's rings chime like crystal bells,
Jupiter's storms drum a thunderous beat,
And Pluto, the outcast, whispers softly,
Of love lost in the vast cosmic fleet.

(Chorus)
Oh, the echoes of the midnight sky,
A celestial ballad of secrets untold,
Each note a comet streaking by,
In this cosmic theater, our story unfolds.

(Outro)
As dawn approaches, the stars retreat,
Their final notes fading into the dawn,
Yet the echoes linger in my heart,
A timeless melody, forever drawn.
